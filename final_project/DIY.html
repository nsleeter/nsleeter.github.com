<h3>Historical Investigation: Do it Yourself</h3>

<div id="content">
<h3>1. Pick an asylum</h3>

<p>You may choose one of the asylums featured in the exhibits.  You can also research a different one.  Like me you might investigate an institution features in a movie or television show.  You could also search Flickr which has a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/asylums">category of asylum pictures </a> submitted by enthusiasts who explore abandoned urban places. 
</p>

<h3>2. Research your primary sources</h3>
<p>
Again using the primary sources that I use in the exhibits is fine.  You could also do your own research.   <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_book_search">Google Books Advanced Search</a> (click Full View Only for the best results) has full text documents that relate to many institutions.  <a href="http://www.Archive.org">Archive.org</a> and <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org">HathiTrust Digital Library</a> are other excellent places to begin your research.  

<h3>3. Share something that you find interesting</h3>
<p>
Search the document for references to the institution until you come across something that interests you.  If you have chosen to search the asylums and documents that I have featured, here is where you find a clip that interests you personally.  Take a screen shot of the image or quote it making sure that you tell your readers where you found it.  Then, just as I did, speculate on what you think it means and justify why you think it might be important or interesting.  


</p>
<h3>4. Publish your findings somewhere on the web</h3>
<p>
If you can make your own site, that is great, but publishing on your class blog would work just as well.  You could also use social media like Tumblr. I would also like to display your findings on this site so <a href="mailto:nsleeter@gmail.com?subject=Making History in the Asylum">
please send me the link</a>.
