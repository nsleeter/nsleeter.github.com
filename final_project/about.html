<h4>About the Site</h4>
<h3>Learning Goals</h3>

<p> <i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> aims to provide a sense of how historians approach the past and investigate history.  From both my experience as an educator and as a scholar studying how the past is presented in culture, I have come the conclusion that historians need to explain what we do and why it matters.  We need to give students, and the public, a better sense of what it means to do history, much in the same way science education introduces students to scientific methods by studying in a lab.  <i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> seeks to be one small example of what history's version of a chemistry lab might look like. 
</p>




<h3>A Historian's Rough Draft</h3>
<p>
I developed <i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> with close attention to the scholarship of teaching and learning in general and in history in particular. Educational psychologist Sam Wineburg has noted that historical thinking is difficult to teach students, because historians themselves rarely record the process of their thinking &#8212; we don't have access to their rough drafts.  As a historian-in-training, therefore, I think it would be useful to explicitly demonstrate the skills I am learning but have yet to master. It is my hope that my inexpertise might actually be advantageous for students to see how historians learn to think about the evidence they use to bring meaning to the past. <a href="http://www.kappanmagazine.org/content/89/3/168.abstract">Wineburg has also written convincingly</a> of the need for history educators to recognize that students ideas about the past are built in large part from the "cultural curriculum" in which they live.  Movies, TV shows, and other forms of popular culture shape their ideas about history and Wineburg argues that educators must explicitly engage these connections.  <i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> addresses these concerns as well by using popular culture's use of asylums as a starting off point for historical investigation.  
</p>
<h3>Authentic Assessment</h3>
<p>
<i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> is also premised the wealth of education literature demonstrating the benefits of <a href="http://jfmueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/whatisit.htm"></a>authentic assessment, in which <a href="http://jfmueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/whatisit.htm">"students are asked to perform real-world tasks that demonstrate meaningful application of essential knowledge and skills".</a>"students are asked to perform real-world tasks that demonstrate meaningful application of essential knowledge and skills". As such, <i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> asks students to create a public historical exhibit which will have the following elements &#8212;

uses actual evidence from the past (primary sources) and attempts to interpret what they might mean. Considerable scaffolding exists as a student may use the asylum and primary source examples I provide &#8212 while looking for their own piece of evidence within that source. Students are encouraged to use tentative language and avoid firm conclusions, just as a professional historian would when beginning a research project.  The only other requirement is that students justify their choices &#8212; why did they choose this piece of evidence?  How did they come to their interpretation of its meaning?</p>

<h3>Rubric</h3>

Student projects will be judged on three criteria:
<ul>
<li>Find Evidence</li>

<li>Interpret Evidence</li>

<li>Justify Choices</li>
