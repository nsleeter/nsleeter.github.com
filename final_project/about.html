<h2>Making History in the Asylum</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p> <i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> aims to provide a sense of how historians approach the past and investigate history.  From both my experience as an educator and as a scholar studying how the past is presented in culture, I have come the conclusion that historians need to explain what we do and why it matters.  We need to give students, and the public, a better sense of what it means to do history, much in the same way science education introduces students to scientific methods by studying in a lab.  <i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> seeks to be one small example of what history's version of a chemistry lab might look like. I developed <i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> with close attention to the scholarship of teaching and learning in general and history in particular.      </p>




<h3>A Historian's Rough Draft</h3>
<p>
I developed <i>Looking Beyond Ghost Stories</i> with close attention to the scholarship of teaching and learning in general and history in particular. Educational psychologist Sam Wineburg has noted that historical thinking is difficult to teach students, because historians themselves rarely record the process of their thinking.  As a historian in training, therefore, I think it would be useful to explicitly demonstrate the skills I am learning but have yet to master. It is my hope that my inexpertise might actually be advantageous for students to see how historians learn to think about the evidence they use to bring meaning to the past.

<h3>Authentic Assessment</h3>
<p>
Students will create a public historical exhibit which will have the following elements --

Uses actual evidence from the past (primary sources) and attempts to interpret what they might mean. Firm conclusions are not necessary and doubt is OK.  It should also be fully acceptable for groups to work on this together and for the project to be open-ended.  The only other requirement is that students justify their choices -- why did they choose this piece of evidence?  How did they come to their interpretation of its meaning?

Find Evidence

Interpret Evidence

Justify Choices
